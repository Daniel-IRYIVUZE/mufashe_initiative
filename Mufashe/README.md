## Project Title:
Mufashe Initiative - Supporting Young Mothers in Rwanda

## Description:
Mufashe Initiative is an online platform that provides mentorship, mental health resources, and a supportive community for young women in Rwanda who became pregnant early. The platform aims to create a safe space where young mothers can find help, connect with mentors, and access useful resources.

## Team Members:
- **Divine Nibuhoro** 
- **Daniel Iryivuze**

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for structuring the web pages.
- **SASS** (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) for styling, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## Development Process:

### 1. Project Setup & Planning:
- **Review Figma Design:** Analyzed the Figma design to identify sections, elements, and styling.
- **Project Structure:** Organized the project with a structured file system:
  ```
  Mufashe/
  ├── index.html
  ├── css/
  │   ├── style.scss  (Main SASS file)
  │   ├── components/ (For partials, e.g., _buttons.scss, _forms.scss)
  │   └── ...
  └── README.md
  ```
- **SASS Setup:** Configured SASS for styling with a "Live Sass Compiler" compiler in VS Code.

### 2. HTML Structure:
- Used **semantic HTML** elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for logical content organization.
- Ensured **clean and readable code** with proper indentation and comments.
- Considered **accessibility** principles with appropriate ARIA attributes and structured headings.

### 3. SASS Styling:
- Implemented **modular SASS**, organizing styles into partials for better maintainability.
- Used **variables** for colors, fonts, and spacing values.
- Leveraged **nesting** for concise and structured styles.
- Applied **mixins** for reusable styles like buttons and forms.
- Followed **CSS/SASS best practices** for maintainability.
- Added **responsive design** using media queries for better mobile experience.

### 4. Version Control & Collaboration:
- Committed code regularly to GitHub with **descriptive commit messages**.
- Utilized **branches and pull requests** for collaboration.

### 5. Testing & Refinement:
- Performed **cross-browser testing** to ensure consistency across different browsers.
- Conducted **code reviews** to maintain quality and adherence to best practices.

## Key Features:
- **Mentorship Program:** Connect young mothers with experienced mentors.
- **Mental Health Support:** Access counseling services and self-care tips.
- **Inspiring Stories:** Read real-life success stories from other young mothers.
- **Resource Center:** Find scholarships, financial aid, and legal support.
- **Community Forum:** Engage with a supportive network of women facing similar challenges.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- **Accuracy:** Does the implementation match the Figma design?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, structured, and maintainable?
- **SASS Usage:** Are variables, nesting, mixins, and partials effectively utilized?
- **Best Practices:** Are HTML and SASS best practices followed?
- **Version Control:** Are commits regular and descriptive?
- **Collaboration:** Are branches and pull requests used effectively?

## Pro Tips:
- Start with the basic structure and gradually enhance styling.
- Utilize browser developer tools for debugging.
- Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
- Seek help when needed!

This project will solidify front-end development skills and demonstrate the ability to translate design concepts into functional code.
